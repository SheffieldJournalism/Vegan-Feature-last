      <p class="intropp"> <span class= "foodhallfirst"> You </span> might be surprised to hear that the academy award winning actress Natalie Portman lives a vegan lifestyle. She said:
<br><br> “Everyone has to find what is right for them, and it is different for everyone. Eating for me is how you proclaim your beliefs three times a day. That is why all religions have rules about eating. Three times a day, I remind myself that I value life and do not want to cause pain to or kill other living beings. That is why I eat the way I do.”
<br><br> She isn’t the only big name either: Woody Harrelson, Joaquin Phoenix, Jessica Chastain, Ellen DeGeneres and even Ariana Grande are all celebrities who only partake in plant-based grub.
<br><br> What does this mean? Well, veganism is on the rise, and that’s a fact. According to a recent survey by <a href="https://www.comparethemarket.com/car-insurance/content/cars-against-humanity/?awc=7896_1525094377_0d17e720fd4622c2ead4c6867683837a&AFFCLIE=EE11&APUID=201309&utm_source=AffiliateProgramme&utm_medium=Website&utm_campaign=AffiliateWindow&utm_content=AffiliateLink">Comparethemarket.com</a>, the amount of people identifying as a vegan in the UK is at a record high, with 3.5 million brits shunning the cheese and giving meat the boot. That’s around 7% of the UK’s entire population!
<br><br> Not that you should be particularly shocked, after all, it sometimes feels like you see a new vegan café being opened every week. Maybe you even popped into your favourite restaurant recently and noticed a suspicious increase in the number of menu options with a lovely little green “V” next to them.
<br><br> This isn’t any different for Sheffield, so we decided that we wanted to give people who live in the Steel City a bit more context about living the vegan way.
<br><br> In here, you’re going to find all sorts of handy information. We’ve got interviews with some of Sheffield’s finest vegan outlets. We’ve spoken to a proper professional and had a chat with a pair of YouTube stars. We’ve also got information on what is great about being a vegan… and even a little bit about why it might not be so great.
<br><br> What you waiting for then, get stuck in!

The community even had to step in for a while to run the place for several months before Stancill Brewery’s Thomas Gill and Adam Hague stepped in to save the day.
<br><br>The pub has seen a new lease of life, including an all new focus on food with “Try It Tuesdays” where out-of-the-ordinary tastes get to shine – including vegan!
<br><br>The Head Chef, Rose Heggie, said: “I think as a chef, there has definitely been an increase in the demand for vegan food in the past 3 years, not just the last year.”
<br><br>“We try to do a lot of the dishes in a way that it isn't obviously vegan to try to encourage non-vegans to also try different foods, and overall we've had very positive feedback.”
<br><br>“My mum and dad have always been vegetarian, so adapting certain recipes wasn't hard to do. I joined the Vegan group to get a better feel for what was new, and what was desired from vegans in Sheffield, to help with menu development.”

<br><br>They specialise in providing Sheffield with a wide range of donuts, brownies, cakes, flapjacks, pretzels and even ice cream sundaes that are all so appetising that many customers don’t even realise they’re animal-free at all!
<br><br>We had a chat with the owner, Ruth Thorpe, who said: “Our inspiration basically comes from our appetite. We like to challenge ourselves to veganise foods that we used to enjoy before we quit animal products, and find ways to get the same taste and texture as you'd get from eggs and dairy."
<br><br>“There's a lot of myths about vegans being skinny, weak, pale and having to live on supplements all the time. We work to try to change the general perspective on that.”

<br><br>The Burger Garden had previously been known as <i>Burgerlolz</i>, but had a big re-brand to better reflect its plant-based fast food.
<br><br>There’s a whole new menu too, including huge milkshakes, the korean burger with bulbogi beef strips (without the actual beef), and even a tofu bratwurst.
<br><br>Maisie Manterfield, owner of The Burger Garden, said: “At the time (of opening) there was nothing else in Sheffield 100% vegan and in general there was no-where to get really good, vegan junk food."
<br><br>"The world is changing and getting really full. Veganism is ethical and great for the animals, but it's also important for the planet that people start thinking about where their food has come from."
<br><br>"We're always experimenting in our kitchen; The Burger Garden is ran by foodies so there's always more new stuff than we can fit on the menu. "Our aim is to make vegan food accessible and convenient to everyone.”"

              The two former Sheffield residents, Ian Theasby and Henry Firth, have accrued over 1.5 million Facebook followers by sharing their famous, top-down videos of plant-based recipes.
              <br><br> It all started after the pair struggled with a trial of veganism at the start of 2015, and began reading about the positive impact a vegan diet could have on the world.
              <br><br> The pair recently launched their brand new book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BOSH-Recipes-Amazing-anticipated-cookbook/dp/000826290X/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1521820878&sr=1-1&utm_source=Direct"> (which you can buy here)</a>, and told us about what inspired them to write it.

<p class="foodhallpp"> <span class="foodhallfirst">The</span> Food Hall has gained a lot of reputation over the past few months in the steel city as one of the best community-led destinations.
<br><br>This pay-as-you-feel café is staffed entirely by volunteers, and much of the food and drink being served has been donated by local stores – rather than getting chucked in the bin. Everything on offer is almost always vegan-friendly, because it’s cheap to buy and easy to cook.
<br><br>We spoke to one of the volunteers there, who told us that: “Foodhall was inspired by similar projects like Indian Ashrams. It's a space for people to share food, ideas, and each other's company. Food is used as a way to bring people together into a community.”
<br><br>“Veganism is cheap, that's the main reason it's a good idea. The cheapest protein sources, lentils and beans, are vegan - so it's the cheapest way to eat a nutritious diet. It's important in society that people have enough nutritious food to eat, and veganism is the best way to do that.”
<br><br>“I don't think individuals going vegan is that important. More important would be better restrictions on farming so that harmful and inhumane practices are no longer commonplace. Even more important than that, is that food waste is ended by building infrastructure to bring waste food to the people who need it.”
<br><br>Food Hall often hosts social eating events on Wednesday nights, to give Sheffield a communal, culinary taste experience.

        <br><br> Many people had even tried vegan food themselves and really liked it! Whilst they hadn't quite researched the benefits of the plant-based diet themselves, many of them had found themselves amidst conversations about it.

        <br><br> After all, people have been consuming meat and dairy for thousands and thousands of years, and that's because it is simply a lot easier to get all the valuable nutrition we need from these types of food.
        <br><br> Then there are the alternatives to veganism to think about. Lab grown meat has gained a lot of momentum over the past few years, and if it continues its current course, it could end much of the environmental damage carnivorous diets potentially have on the world.

        <h4> Thank you and goodbye! </h4>
      <span class= "foodhallfirst">It’s </span> fair to say that the rise in veganism is very apparent across Sheffield. You’ve got café’s opening left right and centre, health experts discussing the benefits of the lifestyle and Sheffield buddies ‘BOSH’ making their break with the launch of their own 100% vegan recipe book.
      <br><br>We’ve found that even the meat eaters of Sheffield are more open to trying this lifestyle and can’t escape the vegan activists in the city centre.

    <center>  <div class= "wow zoomInUp" data-wow-duration="1.2s"> <div class="carouselconc">
          <div><center>  <img src="images/leaflet1.jpg"  alt="" /> </center> </div>
        <div><center>  <img src="images/leaflet2.jpg"  alt="" />  </center></div>
          <div><center>  <img src="images/leaflet3.jpg"  alt="" />  </center></div>
      </div> </center>
There are clearly many positives to a vegan lifestyle that’ve been illustrated above- the health benefits, the cheap food shops and, of course, all the colourful food! So there’s no surprise that 2018 seems to be the year of the vegan.
<br><br>We touched upon arguments against it and obviously this lifestyle won’t be for everyone but we can’t deny the growing popularity of it and we now definitely see what all the fuss is about!
